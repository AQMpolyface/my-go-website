                <p>
                    I have a passion for computers and have recently delved into
                    programming. I am proficient in Go and have some experience
                    with JavaScript. I aspire to learn a variety of programming
                    languages, including Zig, Gleam, Odin, C, C++, Dart, and
                    Assembly.

                    I am also interested in cybersecurity! I have started taking
